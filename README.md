Student athletes and their coaches do not have an effective way of communicating about and keeping track of training routines. Without an improved method of communication, it is difficult for 1) students to instantly update their coach about conflicting academic commitments or poor health conditions, and 2) coaches to optimize practice sessions for each team member based on individual feedback.

Trackr is a web user interface created to address this problem. More information can be found here: https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/display/6DOT813sp16/Trackr.
